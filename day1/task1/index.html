    <h3>Also known as: Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong> (born October 15, 1931,
      <i>Rameswaram</i>, India—died July 27, 2015, <i>Shillong</i>) was an
      Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
      development of <i>India’s missile</i> and <i>nuclear weapons</i> programs.
      He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. His scientific achievements
      and popularity gained him the epithets <b>“Missile Man”</b> and
      <b>“People’s President”</b>.
    </p>

    <h2><ins>Early life and career:</ins></h2>

    <p>
      Kalam was born in a town in <i>Tamil Nadu</i> state to a fishing boat
      owner from a once wealthy family. The youngest of five siblings, Kalam
      persevered with his education despite his impoverished circumstances. He
      earned a degree in <b>Aeronautical Engineering</b> from
      <b>The Madras Institute of Technology</b>
      and in 1958 joined the
      <i>Defence Research and Development Organisation</i> <b>(DRDO)</b>. In
      1969 he moved to the <i>Indian Space Research Organisation</i>
      <b>(ISRO)</b>, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first
      satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. In
      1980 SLV-III successfully released a satellite called Rohini into
      near-Earth orbit, taking India’s space program to the international stage.
      Kalam oversaw further development of launch vehicle technologies at ISRO,
      including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
    </p>

    <h2><ins>Missile program:</ins></h2>

    <p>
      Having rejoined DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the Integrated Guided Missile
      Development Programme, which produced a number of successful missiles.
      Among them was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile,
      which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III; it was first launched in 1989.
      Another success was the surface-to-surface tactical missile Prithvi.
    </p>

    <h2><ins>Nuclear tests:</ins></h2>
    <p>
      From 1992 to 1999 Kalam was scientific adviser to India’s defense
      minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001)
      to the government, with the rank of cabinet minister. During this period
      he played a key role in the government’s weaponization of missile systems,
      giving India nuclear capabilities. In 1998 he was one of the chief
      coordinators of the Pokhran-II series of nuclear tests, in which five
      bombs were detonated at a test range in the town of Pokhran, Rajasthan
      state. His prominent role in the country’s nuclear weapons tests
      solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national
      hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
      community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology
      Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from
      a less-developed society to a developed one in 20 years. Among other
      measures, the plan called for increasing agricultural productivity,
      emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and for widening
      access to health care and education.
    </p>

    <h2><ins>Presidency:</ins></h2>

    <p>
      In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward
      Kalam to succeed outgoing Pres. Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam’s stature
      and popular appeal were such that he was nominated by the Hindu
      nationalist (Hindutva) NDA despite his being Muslim, and even the main
      opposition party, the Indian National Congress, proposed his candidacy.
      Kalam easily won the vote of the electoral college, defeating former
      revolutionary leader Lakshmi Sahgal. He was sworn in as India’s 11th
      president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the
      end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s
      first woman president.
    </p>

    <h2><ins>Legacy:</ins></h2>

    <p>
      Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science
      and technology to transform India into a developed country, and he served
      as a lecturer at a number of universities. He was a visiting professor at
      several campuses of the Indian Institute of Management and the founding
      chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology
      (Thiruvananthapuram). He had great success in connecting with children and
      made it a personal mission to meet, interact with, and inspire young
      minds.
      <br />
      Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire
      (1999), and a book titled Ignited Minds (2002). Among his numerous awards
      were three of the country’s highest honors: the Padma Bhushan (1981), the
      Padma Vibhushan (1990), and the Bharat Ratna (1997).

      <br />
      A number of roads, buildings, and institutions are named for Kalam. In
      2015 the name of a missile test site in Odisha state was changed from
      Wheeler Island to Abdul Kalam Island. In 2017 a new species of bacterium
      found in the International Space Station was named Solibacillus kalamii in
      his honor.
